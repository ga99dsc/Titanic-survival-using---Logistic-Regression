# Titanic-survival-using---Logistic-Regression
This is my first ML data analysis. 
Intention is to practice myself have the code handy and accessible to myself (and anyone who might be interested) anytime, anywhere
The notes I have taken in the jupyter code, are meant to explain the choice of syntax and the reason why I chose the flow of the code.
